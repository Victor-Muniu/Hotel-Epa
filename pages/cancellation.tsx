            <p>This Cancellation Policy applies to all bookings made directly through our website, reservation system, or by contacting our reservations team. It governs the terms under which guests may cancel their reservations and the financial implications of such cancellations.</p>
            <p>Please read this policy carefully before completing your booking, as acceptance of the booking terms constitutes your agreement to these cancellation conditions.</p>

            <h2 className="cancellation-section-title">2. Definition of Key Terms</h2>
            <h3 className="cancellation-subsection-title">Cancellation</h3>
            <p>A cancellation occurs when a guest formally requests to cancel their confirmed reservation prior to their scheduled check-in date. A written notice of cancellation must be received by Epashikino Resort & Spa through email, phone, or in-person request.</p>
            
            <h3 className="cancellation-subsection-title">No-Show</h3>
            <p>A no-show occurs when a guest fails to arrive for their reservation without prior notification or cancellation request. If a guest does not check in on their scheduled arrival date and has not communicated with the resort, the reservation is classified as a no-show.</p>
            
            <h3 className="cancellation-subsection-title">Important Distinction</h3>
            <p className="cancellation-highlight"><strong>Cancellation and no-show are different and are treated differently under this policy.</strong> A cancellation allows a guest to recover the majority of their funds, while a no-show results in no refund, as the resort must absorb the full cost of the reserved room and services.</p>

            <h2 className="cancellation-section-title">3. Cancellation Retention Policy</h2>
            <h3 className="cancellation-subsection-title">Standard Cancellation Fee</h3>
            <p>In the event of a cancellation, Epashikino Resort & Spa retains <strong>25% of the total booking revenue</strong> to cover administrative costs, operational losses, and potential loss of revenue from declining other bookings for those dates.</p>
            <p>The remaining <strong>75% of the booking amount will be refunded</strong> to the original payment method within 7-14 business days of the cancellation request.</p>

            <p>Guests may cancel their reservation <strong>up to 7 days before the scheduled check-in date</strong> without incurring the retention fee. Full refunds will be processed for cancellations made within this window.</p>
            
            <h3 className="cancellation-subsection-title">Standard Cancellation (25% Retention)</h3>
            <p>Cancellations made <strong>within 7 days of the check-in date</strong> will be subject to the 25% retention fee. The 75% balance will be refunded to your account.</p>
            
            <h3 className="cancellation-subsection-title">Same-Day Cancellation</h3>
            <p>Cancellations requested on the same day as check-in (after 2:00 PM) or after check-in time has passed may be treated differently. Please contact our reservations team immediately if you need to cancel on the day of arrival.</p>
            
            <h3 className="cancellation-subsection-title">Late Cancellation and No-Show Fees</h3>
            <p>If a guest does not check in on their scheduled arrival date and has not formally cancelled their reservation, the full booking amount will be charged as a no-show fee. <strong>No refund will be issued for no-shows.</strong></p>
